I collaborated on this repository with my partner Max Hymer. It includes our implementation of a Neural Network with Genetic with Real-Valued Chromosomes, 
Differential Evolution, and Particle Swarm Optimization neuron update algorithms along with a design document we created before starting the project and a 
final paper covering the results of the experiments we performed with the algorithms.
